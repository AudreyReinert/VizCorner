The three projects are a visualization of particle accelerator data designed for domain scientists, a presentation of new findings from the fusion community designed for nonexpert adults, and an interactive exhibit of phytoplankton populations tailored toward museum visitors, especially children. Special design decisions had to be made to handle the unique conditions of each scientific area as well as the given background knowledge of the target audience.

@article{Wang2018,
abstract = {Imagine a typical workflow for a climate scientist exploring a 3D volumetric data set produced from a simulation. The data set is time-varying and multivariate, containing scalar and vector quantities. The scientist first plays back the entire time sequence of the precipitation scalar field and spots some features of interest. She wants to extract those features and track them over time. However, the features are difficult to select or pick directly in 3D. Visually tracking multiple features over time is very difficult as she has to rely on her memory to tie together their connections. Furthermore, she also integrates a set of flow lines from the wind velocity vector field and needs to examine their relationships. Visual exploration of these flow lines poses quite a challenge due to the lack of capability to observe them and their spatial relationships in an occlusion-free and controllable fashion. Moving forward, she even hopes to investigate these scalar and vector quantities simultaneously, for instance, identifying regions of high pressure and low precipitation and studying flow lines passing through these regions only, or exploring flow lines that connect attracting spiral saddles and repelling spiral saddles. This becomes increasingly impossible without a new solution for data abstraction and relationship exploration. As the size and complexity of scientific data continue to grow, these challenges will only become more severe.},

abstract = {Abstract In this report, we organize and reflect on recent advances and challenges in the field of sports data visualization. The exponentially-growing body of visualization research based on sports data is a prime indication of the importance and timeliness of this report. Sports data visualization research encompasses the breadth of visualization tasks and goals: exploring the design of new visualization techniques; adapting existing visualizations to a novel domain; and conducting design studies and evaluations in close collaboration with experts, including practitioners, enthusiasts, and journalists. Frequently this research has impact beyond sports in both academia and in industry because it is i) grounded in realistic, highly heterogeneous data, ii) applied to real-world problems, and iii) designed in close collaboration with domain experts. In this report, we analyze current research contributions through the lens of three categories of sports data: box score data (data containing statistical summaries of a sport event such as a game), tracking data (data about in-game actions and trajectories), and meta-data (data about the sport and its participants but not necessarily a given game). We conclude this report with a high-level discussion of sports visualization research informed by our analysis—identifying critical research gaps and valuable opportunities for the visualization community.
